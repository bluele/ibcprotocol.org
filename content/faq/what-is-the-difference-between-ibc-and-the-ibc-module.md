IBC is a generic protocol that can be implemented by a wide variety of state-machines that have different architectures and are built using different programming languages. The IBC module, on the other hand, is the specific implementation of the IBC protocol for the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/). Blockchains that are built on top of the Cosmos SDK can use this module in order to become IBC-compatible.
