The *inter-blockchain communication protocol* is a reliable & secure inter-module communication protocol, where modules are deterministic processes that run on independent machines, including replicated state machines (like "blockchains" or "distributed ledgers") and solo machines. It is compatible with a wide range of blockchains that can vary in properties, consensus algorithms, programming languages and more.

IBC can be used by any application which builds on top of reliable & secure inter-module communication. Example applications include cross-chain asset transfer, atomic swaps, multi-chain smart contracts (with or without mutually comprehensible VMs), and data & code sharding of various kinds.
