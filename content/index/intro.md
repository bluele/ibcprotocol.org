IBC is an interoperability protocol for communicating arbitrary data between arbitrary state machines.

It provides an end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol for reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains or off-chain protocols (rollups), and can accomodate for both known and dynamic validator topologies.

IBC can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications, including but not limited to token transfers, interchain accounts (delegate calls between two chains), non-fungible token transfers and oracle data feeds.
